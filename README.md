Roborock PBC using THT Components.

This repository contains the design and instructions for a fan control circuit using THT, specifically for controlling a Roborock robot vacuum fan used as an external part cooling fan in 3D printers. This design offers several advantages over existing solutions, particularly for those who prefer easier assembly and cost-effective components.

_**Key Features:**_

THT Components: Utilizes through-hole components, making it accessible for hobbyists and easier to solder by hand.

Size: Matches the dimensions of the [BTT U2C](https://github.com/bigtreetech/U2C), ensuring compatibility and ease of integration.


Ease of Assembly: Simplified assembly process compared to SMD (Surface-Mount Device) components.

Component Availability: Parts are easier to source from local and online suppliers.

Cost-Effective: Both the components and the overall production are more affordable.

Background:
The original design and schematic are from this GitHub repository: [Roborock-CPAP](https://github.com/condottab/Roborock-CPAP) by [condottab](https://github.com/condottab). While the original PCB design is in SMD format, this project provides a THT alternative to cater to users looking for a simpler and more accessible solution.
